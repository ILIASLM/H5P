# H5P ILIAS Plugin



This is an OpenSource project by studer + raimann ag, CH-Burgdorf (https://studer-raimann.ch)

This project is licensed under the GPL-3.0-only license

## Installation

Start at your ILIAS root directory

```bash
mkdir -p Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject
cd Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject
git clone https://github.com/studer-raimann/H5P.git H5P
```

Update, activate and config the plugin in the ILIAS Plugin Administration

## Description

H5P offers a wide spectrum of JavaScript libraries to implement didactic content: https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications
This plugin's configuration shows an interface to upload these libraries, or download them directly from the H5P Hub.

In the ILIAS repository, a new object type "H5P" can be created. Inside these objects, administrators are able to create multiple H5P contents from the previously up-/downloaded libraries.

When users work through these contents, the plugin stores their results and make them visible to administrators inside a separate tab. Optionally, the object can be configured to be "Solved only once", so that the series of contents acts like a test or a survey.

Also have a look to [H5PPageComponent](https://github.com/studer-raimann/H5PPageComponent) or [H5PCron](https://github.com/studer-raimann/H5PCron).
